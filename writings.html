      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"> 
        
        <p>There is beauty in innocence</p>
        <p>And innocence in beauty</p>
        <p>Both are within you</p>
        <p>And I hope you can see</p>
        <p>How attractive that can be</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Don’t confuse ignorance with innocence</p>
        <p>As I once did</p>
        <p>Ignorance may be bliss</p>
        <p>But innocence is the tender kiss</p>
        <p>Of a father</p>
        <p>As he says goodnight to his daughter</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>There comes a certain point</p>
        <p>When a person can see</p>
        <p>The love that God has for you</p>
        <p>And me</p>
        <p>That love is contagious</p>
        <p>It likes to grow</p>
        <p>Before awhile it makes you go</p>
        <p>“Which love do I have for you?</p>
        <p>And which love do you have for me</p>
        <p>Which comes first, does it matter?</p>
        <p>If one before the other</p>
        <p>Should I stop and see</p>
        <p>If you could ever have the same love for me?”</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>And if not</p>
        <p>That’s okay</p>
        <p>I’ll continue loving you anyway</p>
        <p>Flowers wilt just as soon as they bloom</p>
        <p>But I hope the same isn’t true</p>
        <p>For the friendship between me and you</p>
        <p>But if it is,</p>
        <p>That’s okay</p>
        <p>I wouldn’t have it any other way</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>You see I’ve come to understand</p>
        <p>That time is fleeting</p>
        <p>And so are we</p>
        <p>I once thought that things that end</p>
        <p>Are best never started</p>
        <p>For the heartbreak that follows</p>
        <p>Can be for some too much to swallow</p>
        <p>But there’s beauty in it all</p>
        <p>Beginning middle and end</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>If the interest ever arises</p>
        <p>I would love to take your hand</p>
        <p>Even if for a moment</p>
        <p>Just so you know</p>
        <p>Without a shadow of a doubt</p>
        <p>That you are important</p>
        <p>But not because of what I see</p>
        <p>But because of who God created you to be</p>

        A Love Letter For Our Second (Month) Anniversary
	The love I have for you is the closest thing I know to the love a parent has for a child. I know I often make this comparison. I’m so glad you have the ability to understand what I’m attempting to get at each time. My inspiration for this letter centered around how you as a person have grown so much. As far as I can see, you were the captain directing the ship during this time of growth. Yes, of course, God put the wind in your sails, but no one sat you down and gave you a plan on how to become the most perfect version of yourself. I have always admired those who take control of their lives and face themselves in the direction of something worthwhile. You are such a person. I see you now not as a different person but as who you were always meant to be.

	I never doubted your abilities when I first met you. At the same time, when I first met you, I didn’t know what your abilities were. It was your beauty that initially drew me in. Quickly it became apparent there was something that attracted me to what went on in your mind as well. 

An inherently special bond exists between a parent and a child. The parent doesn’t need to know anything about the child to love them. The parent just loves them. I don’t compare myself to a parent in this way. Nor do I want to since in a way, it’s the easy way out. The Bible speaks to this when it asks what reward is there for a person who is kind to those who are kind to them. I don’t claim to love you because of an uncontrollable feeling or sense of duty that was present in me the moment I first saw you. 
The love I have for you is like the love a parent has for their adopted child. There are those who have such love in their hearts that they seek out children without a loving home and give them that home. This love comes purely from choice. That’s the love I have for you. 
However, I cannot deny the undeniable: I have feelings for you I have never felt before. I choose to love you as an adoptive parent does, but I also have the added bonus of it feeling natural to love you.
Adoptive or not, a parent watches their child grow over the course of their life. They see the child enter into many different phases, becoming what some would consider completely different people along the way. All the while, the parent has the same love for the child that existed at the beginning. The parent doesn’t see who their child grows into as being any different than the little baby they once held in their arms. 
A parent raises a child with the understanding that one day their child will be able to raise themselves. A parent is fully aware what’s in front of them at the time does not represent the end result. I knew the same when I first met you. I saw what you were, innocent and full of passion (those are just a few of my favorite traits) and knew what you could be. The foundation set was a teaser of what was to come for me. That’s why I’m not so taken back with who you are now. The faintest embers of the love I have for you now began when I was able to gaze briefly into your heart. 
My love started and it keeps on growing. It doesn’t grow on account of you changing into someone whom I find easier to love. The growth is based on me becoming a person with more love in my heart. As I see you grow into the same type of person, I fall in love even more because my heart is backed up by mind. My mind tells me you have the willingness to chase the greatness God has bestowed upon you, and my heart tells me you’re the person I want to do the same with. 
In conclusion, I love you, Alex.
