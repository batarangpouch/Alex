<p>Dear Alex,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Merry Christmas, Alex. It appears you already know what I've been working on. The idea for this came in October when I was working on my first HTML homework assignment in
your bedroom in Boulder. I didn't have all the tools and knowlesge needed then, and I still have a lot to learn, but I have enough now to make something for you and even
teach you how I did it if you're interested. I'm not sure if you'll acutally like it or not, but I hope you will.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's been a wondeful 2020 with you. I'm tempted to feel bad about how well this year has gone when so many have lost so much. Do I just have a good sense of thankfulness
and peace in a time when many don't, or am I just blessed beyond measure? I like to think both. You are an amazing part of my life, and I am so fortunate to wake up and go to bed
every day knowing you are my girlfriend and someday will be my wife. I know it's difficult waiting like we are, but it will be worth it in the end. Our time will come
when God said it should. The first leg of our race will have been run not flawlessly but always with a desire to do better the next day. We should apply that same
approach to all our relationships.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I love you, Alex. Thank you for helping me grow into the man God calls me to be. Merry Christmas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                           Love,</p>
<p>                           Drew</p>
